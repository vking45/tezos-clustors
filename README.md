## Clustors Project built for Tezos

Clustors is a decentralized finance (DeFi) tool that allows users to create, rebalance, and manage portfolios of Tezos-based tokens — like an exchange-traded fund (ETF), but for Tezos tokens — which are themselves tradeable on crypto exchanges. Users can create their own indexes, or buy into someone else’s and share in the success of their portfolio strategies.

Assets created on Clustors similarly to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — derivative assets that provide exposure to baskets of securities, and which trade like a stock. Users can create baskets of crypto tokens, bundle them up into a batch, and then buy, sell, or trade those  batches on exchanges.  

Clustors lets you carry out sophisticated asset-management strategies by determining the exact allocation of individual tokens, setting automated rebalancing parameters, and engaging with a developing suite of functions.

Why Clustors is worth your attention?
Clustors being somewhat similar to Ethereum's well-known Set-protocol ( allows users to to create ERC-20 assets). Holders of clustors can lock their batches and provide liquidity to issue flash loans. Clustors distinguishes itself by offering flash loans to issuers.
Apart from flash loans, the clustors allows users to have peace of mind by not worrying about missed opportunities  or price fluctuations in market. Intended for those who don’t want to constantly monitor crypto trends and worry about manually rebalancing their portfolio.
